      <h5>Discovery of the Ruins</h5>
      <p>The lost city was first discovered in 1924 by explorer John Smith during his expedition through the Amazon rainforest. The stone structures showed advanced architectural techniques not thought to exist in the region at that time.</p>
      
      <h5>Architectural Features</h5>
      <p>The most striking feature is the pyramid-like structure at the center, standing approximately 30 meters tall. The stones fit together without mortar, similar to Incan construction methods.</p>

    alt: "Ancient Knossos palace ruins with labyrinth patterns",
    content: `
      <h5>The Birth of a Monster</h5>
      <p>According to Greek mythology, the Minotaur was born from Queen PasiphaÃ«'s unnatural union with a sacred bull - a divine punishment from Poseidon. King Minos, horrified yet unable to kill the half-bull child, commissioned the brilliant architect Daedalus to build an inescapable labyrinth beneath his palace at Knossos.</p>
      
      <h5>The Labyrinth's Dark Purpose</h5>
      <p>The twisting corridors served as both prison and feeding ground. Every nine years, Athens sent seven youths and seven maidens as tribute to be devoured by the Minotaur. This gruesome tradition continued until Prince Theseus volunteered as sacrifice, determined to end the terror.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        "No one who entered the labyrinth had ever returned - the walls shifted like living things, the very air thick with the stench of blood and madness."
      </blockquote>
      
      <h5>Theseus' Impossible Quest</h5>
      <p>With help from Minos' daughter Ariadne, Theseus unraveled a ball of golden thread to mark his path. Ancient texts describe his confrontation with the Minotaur in vivid detail - the creature's deafening roars, the slick stone floors, and how Theseus used the monster's own brute strength against it.</p>

      <h5>Archaeological Evidence</h5>
      <p>At the ruins of Knossos, archaeologists found:
        <ul>
          <li>Bull motif frescoes dating to 1500 BCE</li>
          <li>A complex palace layout resembling a maze</li>
          <li>Child remains showing possible ritual sacrifice</li>
        </ul>
      Some scholars believe the myth preserves memory of Minoan bull-worship turned monstrous by Greek storytellers.</p>
      
      <h5>The Labyrinth in Modern Culture</h5>
      <p>The legend endures as:
        <ul>
          <li>Psychological symbol of life's complex journeys</li>
          <li>Inspiration for maze designs worldwide</li>
          <li>Metaphor for confronting one's inner demons</li>

      Recent discoveries suggest the myth may have originated from earthquake damage that created maze-like cracks in the palace.</p>
      
      <h5>Lasting Mysteries</h5>
      <p>Key unanswered questions:
        <ul>
          <li>Was Daedalus' labyrinth real architecture or pure myth?</li>
          <li>Did bull-leaping rituals inspire the Minotaur concept?</li>
          <li>Why does this story appear across Mediterranean cultures?</li>
        </ul>
      The truth may lie buried beneath layers of myth and memory.</p>

    alt: "Medieval painting of Vlad III Dracula",
    content: `
      <h5>The Prince of Wallachia</h5>
      <p>Born in 1431, Vlad III earned his gruesome nickname by impaling over 20,000 Ottoman invaders on wooden stakes. As ruler of Wallachia (modern Romania), he used psychological warfare - leaving forests of rotting corpses to terrify enemies. His father, Vlad II Dracul, was a knight in the Order of the Dragon, inspiring the surname "Dracula" meaning "Son of the Dragon."</p>
      
      <h5>Methods of Terror</h5>
      <p>Historical accounts describe his signature punishments:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Golden Cup:</strong> Left a jeweled chalet in public squares - none dared steal it</li>
          <li><strong>Nailhead Diplomacy:</strong> Refused to remove his hat before Ottoman envoys, nailing it to their heads</li>
          <li><strong>Night Attack of 1462:</strong> Sent plague victims' corpses into enemy camps</li>
        </ul>
      His cruelty became legendary when he allegedly dined among impaled corpses during an Ottoman invasion.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        "He roasted children and forced mothers to eat them. He impaled victims through their anus until the stake emerged from their mouth." - German pamphlets, 15th century
      </blockquote>
      
      <h5>From History to Horror</h5>
      <p>Bram Stoker's 1897 novel <em>Dracula</em> blended Vlad's history with Transylvanian folklore:
        <ul>
          <li>Vlad's decapitated head was sent to Constantinople - mirroring vampire beheading myths</li>
          <li>His family castle, Poenari Fortress, resembles descriptions of Castle Dracula</li>
          <li>Romanian word "drac" means both "dragon" and "devil"</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h5>Archaeological Discoveries</h5>
      <p>Recent findings reveal:
        <ul>
          <li>His lost grave at Snagov Monastery contained headless remains</li>
          <li>Chemical analysis shows his letters were written in blood-tinged ink</li>
          <li>Mass graves in TÃ¢rgoviÈte confirm impalement methods</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h5>Was He Hero or Monster?</h5>
      <p>Romanians revere him as:
        <ul>
          <li>A defender against Ottoman expansion</li>
          <li>An early law-and-order ruler who eradicated crime</li>
          <li>A national symbol featured on currency and stamps</li>
        </ul>
      While Western accounts emphasize his sadism, Romanian oral tradition tells of him executing corrupt boyars to protect peasants.</p>

    image: "images/robin.jpg",
    alt: "Medieval illustration of Robin Hood with longbow in Sherwood Forest",
    content: `
      <h5>The Earliest Ballads (13th Century)</h5>
      <p>The first written references appear in court records from 1225-1247 mentioning "Robinhood" fugitives. The oldest surviving ballad, <em>Robin Hood and the Monk</em> (1450), depicts him as a violent yeoman - not the nobleman of later tales. Key early elements include:
        <ul>
          <li>Battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham (a real position)</li>
          <li>Hideouts in Barnsdale Forest (not Sherwood)</li>
          <li>No mention of Maid Marian or giving to the poor</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <blockquote>
        "Robyn hod in scherewod stod" - First known written reference (1377 poem <em>Piers Plowman</em>)
      </blockquote>
  
      <h5>Historical Candidates</h5>
      <p>Scholars propose several real figures who may have inspired the legend:
        <table>
          <tr><th>Name</th><th>Connection</th><th>Period</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Robert Hod</td><td>Fugitive in York records</td><td>1226</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Roger Godberd</td><td>Outlaw who evaded capture</td><td>1260s</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Robert Deyville</td><td>Knight turned rebel</td><td>1290s</td></tr>
        </table>
        The name "Robin Hood" became a generic term for outlaws by 1300.
      </p>
  
      <h5>Evolution of the Merry Men</h5>
      <p>The familiar characters joined the legend at different times:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Little John</strong>: Appears in earliest ballads (size exaggerated later)</li>
          <li><strong>Friar Tuck</strong>: Added in 15th century May Day plays</li>
          <li><strong>Maid Marian</strong>: Merged from French pastoral tales (16th century)</li>
          <li><strong>Will Scarlet</strong>: Originally "Will Scarlok" in 1400s ballads</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <h5>Sherwood Forest Archaeology</h5>
      <p>Recent discoveries in Nottinghamshire:
        <ul>
          <li>12th-century hunting lodge that may have inspired the Sheriff's base</li>
          <li>Medieval arrowheads matching longbow descriptions</li>
          <li>Caves with hearths dated to 1200s (possible hideouts)</li>
        </ul>
        The Major Oak tree (now a tourist site) couldn't have been his hideout - it's only 800 years old.
      </p>
  
      <h5>Why the Legend Endures</h5>
      <p>Robin Hood represents:
        <ul>
          <li>Resistance to oppressive taxation (especially relevant during the 1381 Peasants' Revolt)</li>
          <li>Medieval class struggle between Saxons and Normans</li>
          <li>The romantic ideal of honorable banditry</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>The Fateful Insult (1701)</h5>
      <p>When Lord Asano Naganori drew his sword in Edo Castle and wounded protocol master Kira Yoshinaka, he violated strict shogunate laws. Forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide), his 300 samurai became masterless ronin. After two years of planning, 47 loyal retainers swore vengeance.</p>
  
      <h5>The Night of Attack (1703)</h5>
      <p>On January 30th, during a snowstorm, the ronin struck Kira's heavily guarded Edo mansion:
        <ul>
          <li>Split into two assault teams (front and rear gates)</li>
          <li>Used wooden ladders to scale walls</li>
          <li>Captured Kira alive (identified by his scar)</li>
        </ul>
      They beheaded him with the same dagger Asano used for seppuku.</p>
